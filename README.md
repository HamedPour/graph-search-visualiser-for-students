# graph-search-visualiser-for-students

A simple and interactive visualization tool for teaching **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms. This tool allows students to explore how these algorithms work step-by-step on a dynamically generated grid maze.

## Live Demo

Try it out here: [Graph Search Visualizer](https://hamedpour.github.io/graph-search-visualiser-for-students/)

## Features

- **Interactive Grid Maze**:
  - Dynamically set the size of the maze.
  - Click to set the target (treasure) cell.
- **Algorithm Visualization**:
  - Visualize BFS and DFS algorithms with animation.
  - See the pathfinding in action, step-by-step.
- **Treasure Cell**:
  - The goal is marked with a treasure chest emoji (`ðŸ’Ž`).
  - Animated feedback when the target is reached.

## How to Use

1. **Set Maze Size**:
   - Enter the number of rows/columns in the input field.
   - Click "Create Maze" to generate the grid.
2. **Set Target**:
   - Click on any cell to mark it as the target.
3. **Visualize Search**:
   - Click the "Breadth-First Search" or "Depth-First Search" buttons to start the visualization.
